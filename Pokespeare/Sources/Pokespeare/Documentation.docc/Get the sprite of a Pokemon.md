# Get the sprite of a Pokemon

Retrieve a beautiful image of your favourite Pokemon

## Overview

Every Pokemon needs to be represented in its best form. You can implement your own ``PokemonSpriteLoader`` protocol to get the coolest sprite, or you can use the built-in  ``RemotePokemonSpriteLoader`` which will fetch the sprite from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
