Unleash the power of your Pokedex and provide people powerful ways to retrieve informations about their favourite Pokemons.

## Overview

With Pokespeare you can fetch the network to get various informations about Pokemons, such as their description and sprite.
The library is designed to be easy and fun to use (for example you can use ``ShakespeareanPokemonDescriptor`` to get a poetic description of your favourite Pokemon) and provides a simple and extensible interface for developers to work with.
