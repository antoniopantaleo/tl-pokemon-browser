# TL Challenge

This is my solution for the Mobile Engineer Challenge.
The repository contains both the [SDK](https://github.com/antoniopantaleo/tl-pokemon-browser/tree/develop/Pokespeare) I built as a Swift Package, and the [Demo Application](https://github.com/antoniopantaleo/tl-pokemon-browser/tree/develop/Pokemon%20Browser) that uses the SDK.

Unit tests get executed every push or PR in the develop branch through [Github Actions](https://github.com/antoniopantaleo/tl-pokemon-browser/actions).
